Please login to the PayPal Developer's site, and start a sandbox in
the Business account you want to test.

Review the Business accounts transaction history:

    My Account -> History (tab)

Follow the 'Details' link for a transaction (whose status is
'Completed') that occurred in the past 60 days.

Copy the Transaction ID for that transaction. It may appear like this:

    Express Checkout Payment Received (ID # 2DE2563K55B16978M)

_TRANSID_

print STDERR "\nType or paste that Transaction ID here and hit Enter: \n";

my $transid = <STDIN>; chomp $transid;

die "Need a transaction id.\n" unless $transid;

my %resp = $pp->RefundTransaction( TransactionID => $transid,
                                   RefundType    => 'Full',
                                   Memo          => 'Fancy refund time.' );

like( $resp{Ack}, qr/Success/ , "Successful refund." );

if( $resp{Ack} ) {
    print STDERR <<"_REFUND_";

You may now login to your Business sandbox account and verify the
transaction was refunded.
