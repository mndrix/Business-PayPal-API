Business-PayPal-API version 0.62
================================

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   WPP_TEST=auth.txt make test
   make install

Please notice that this module requires you have several things before
you can test it:

  - a sandbox personal PayPal account
  - a sandbox business PayPal account
  - API credentials (either a certificate or signature)
  - auth.txt, which contains your API credentials

Acquiring these things is your job, not mine. Read PayPal's
and this module's documentation to learn more.

If you do not set the WPP_TEST environment variable, sandbox tests
will be skipped.

The format of the authentication tokens file defined by WPP_TEST may
be found in the Business::PayPal::API documentation under
"TESTING". Sample auth.txt files may be found in 'auth.sample.3token'
and 'auth.sample.cert' in this distribution.

USAGE

  use Business::PayPal::API qw( ExpressCheckout );

  my $pp = new Business::PayPal::API( Username => 'my_api.username.tld',
                                      Password => 'API_PASSWORD',
                                      CertFile => '/path/to/cert.pem',
                                      KeyFile  => '/path/to/key.pem', );

  ...
  my %details = $pp->GetExpressCheckoutDetails( $token );
